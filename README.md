# Cabin Project


## Idea
Horror game in which the player must gather resources and explore the land to maintain their health and the security of their cabin. The player must use stealth to avoid dangerous creatures. More dangerous creatures are present as the player progresses. At night the creatures are stronger but stealth is easier... but formidable monster will also relentlessly hunt down the player.


## Story
* Incorporate psychological dread (repressed fears in player/character). 
* Realistic features on models unexpectedly for uncanny effect. 
* 4th wall break?
* Notes from past graveyard keepers to establish history or no notes, to show a story. 
* Occult?

## Resources
The player has limited inventory and must therefore stockpile. Note that 24 in-game hours = 30 minutes, 48 in-game minute = 1 min

### Hunger	
- Total: 100.
- Hunger depletes at a rate of 10 p/h.
- Reaches 0, Player dies. 

### Energy	
- Total: 100.
- Every action the player performs has varying costs to energy, including:
	-	Running
	-	Cooking, Wood gathering, Wood processing, Barricading and other complex interactions
- Energy is replenished by sleeping, where E p/hr = Hunger / 12.
- Reaches 0: Player can no longer perform any of the above. Walking speed is halved.

### Food	
Vegetables, fruits and mushrooms found in the forest can be cooked. 
Replenishes hunger bar by x after 10 foods are cooked in a stew. 
Can be carried in stacks of 10.

### Wood	
Wood can be cut from trees.
Loud gathering process attracts monster if in range.
Three wood which is processed by the sawmill can be turned into planks, used for barricading windows in the cabin. 
Barricades prevent the monster from entering the house while you’re not home and stealing your resources and giving you a fright when you come home!
Can be carried in stacks of 3.

### Oil 	
Oil can be found around buildings.
The monster avoids bright light, therefore lighting lanterns with oil is required for night. 

### Petrol	
Gather petrol for car to escape in
